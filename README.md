# Symmetric Difference Function

A JavaScript implementation of a function that computes the symmetric difference between two arrays using the filter method. 
The function returns all items that appear in only one of the two arrays, but not in both.

## Objective

Implement the diffArray function to satisfy the following user stories:
The function should return an array.
The function should accept two arguments, both arrays.
The function must make use of the filter method.
The function should return the symmetric difference of the two arrays.
If there is no symmetric difference, the function should return an empty array.
